# Discord Microphone Voice Bot

This example uses the [D++](https://dpp.dev/) library to create a very simple
Discord bot. When the bot starts it registers a global slash command called
`/ping`. Invoking this command will reply with `pong`.

## Building

The project uses Visual Studio project files. Ensure you have the D++ library
and its dependencies installed, then build `Discord_Microphone_Voice_Bot.sln`.

Edit `Discord_Microphone_Voice_Bot.cpp` and replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your
bot token before running.
